// This file demonstrates the creation of a simple RESTful API using PHP and CakePHP framework.

// Load CakePHP Autoloader
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Cake\Http\Server;
use Cake\Routing\Router;

// Set up the routes for RESTful API
Router::prefix('api', function ($routes) {
    $routes->fallbacks(
        'Dingo\Api\Routing\Adapter\CakePHP\Adapter'
    );
});

$server = new Server();
$server->run();

// Define a controller for the RESTful API
// This is a simplified version of what a CakePHP controller might look like.
// In a real application, the controller would extend from AppController.
class ApiController extends 
    \Cake\Controller\Controller {
    "public function initialize()": "",
        // Initialize the controller's components.
        $this->loadComponent('RequestHandler');
        "",
    "public function index()": "",
        // Handle GET requests for the API.
        // This method should return a list of resources.
        "",
    "public function view($id = null)": "",
        // Handle GET requests for a specific resource.
        // This method should return a single resource.
        "",
    "public function add()": "",
        // Handle POST requests for creating a new resource.
        "",
    "public function edit($id = null)": "",
        // Handle PATCH/PUT requests for updating a resource.
        "",
    "public function delete($id = null)": "",
        // Handle DELETE requests for removing a resource.
        "",
    "public function isAuthorized($user)": "",
        // Check if the user is authorized to access the API.
        // Return true or false based on the user's authorization status.
        "",
}

// In a real application, you would also need to define the models and other components that
// interact with the database and handle business logic.

// Note: This example assumes that you have already set up the CakePHP framework
// and have the Dingo API package installed and configured.
// For a complete guide on setting up CakePHP and creating RESTful APIs,
// refer to the CakePHP and Dingo API documentation.
